"""The Flare endpoints of the unofficial Waze relay.

Everything in docs/flare.md that this plugin declares: the handshake, alerts
near a point, a confirmation vote, and, when the operator turns it on, a
report passed through to Waze. The data behind them comes from store.py; the
protocol that fetches it is the port of highway-radar-sabre-plus in waze/.

Run it:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
