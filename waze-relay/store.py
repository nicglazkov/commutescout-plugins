"""The tile poller and the Flare records it serves.

Coverage is demand-driven, not a fixed box. The plugin answers for anywhere
in its coverage, but it only fetches tiles somebody actually asked about in
the last ten minutes: an unasked tile costs Waze nothing, however wide the
coverage box is. There is no background sweep of the box.

A tile is a tenth of a degree, about 11 km on a side, and each one is
fetched with a single query at city zoom. That size is the point. The
upstream thins what it returns for a wide viewport the same way the app
shows fewer pins zoomed out, and the previous design, which queried
one-degree cells from four points with boxes 70 km wide, held 43 alerts for
the whole Los Angeles basin on a weekday afternoon. A caller asks for a
disc around a person or a point along a route, the disc becomes the few
tiles it touches, and every tile is fetched at a zoom where the upstream
sends everything it has.

One session runs one query at a time, so the tiles take turns, stalest
first, and no tile is fetched more often than once per refresh window.
The wanted set is capped; past the cap the tiles nobody has asked about
for longest drop out, so a flood of asks degrades to slower laps rather
than to nothing.

Alerts themselves are kept in one cache for the whole service rather than
one per tile, because the RT protocol sends each alert once per session and
not once per query: an alert first delivered to one tile's query is never
re-sent for the neighbouring tile that overlaps it. See waze/cache.py.

    """The confirmations this plugin collected, kept in memory.

    Waze itself gets nothing from them: they raise the confirmation count and
    the confidence the plugin reports, and enough "not there" votes hide the
    alert.

    Hiding an alert is the one destructive thing a caller can ask for, and
    these alerts are drawn on a map people drive by, so who is allowed to ask
    matters. A vote used to be counted once per ``reporter`` string taken
    straight from the request body. On a listing that advertises no
    authentication that is not an identity, it is a field: three requests
    with three invented strings hid any alert the plugin served.

    So a vote is counted once per VOTER, and a voter is:

    * ``t:<reporter>`` when the caller presented the configured confirm
      token. A mediated backend forwarding many people's votes is one
      address but many reporters, and its reporter strings are pseudonyms it
      derived, so they can be trusted once the caller has been.
    * ``a:<address>`` otherwise. An unauthenticated caller counts once per
      address however many strings it invents, so hiding an alert costs
      three distinct addresses rather than three lines of shell.

    The two namespaces never collide, so an unauthenticated caller cannot
    dress its votes up as trusted ones.

    The trust split is not only about hiding. An "up" vote raises the
    published ``n_confirmations``, and a caller downstream may read a well
    confirmed closure as a reason to send every driver somewhere else, so a
    forgeable count is a way to close a road rather than a cosmetic one.
    Untrusted votes therefore count towards hiding and nothing else: they
    can weaken what this plugin says, never strengthen it, and never extend
    an alert's life.
