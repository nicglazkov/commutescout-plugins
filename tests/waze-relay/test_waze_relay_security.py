The relay is listed publicly with no authentication and what it serves is
drawn on a map people drive by, so the interesting cases here are the ones
where a caller is lying: inventing voters to hide an alert, inventing a
forwarded address to get a fresh rate-limit bucket, or guessing a token one
byte at a time.
